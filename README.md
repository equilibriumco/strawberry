## Introduction

Strawberry is an implementation of the JAM (JOIN-ACCUMULATE MACHINE) client for Polkadot, developed in Go. This implementation aims to provide a lightweight, performant, and secure JAM client.

For more information about JAM, read the [graypaper](https://graypaper.com).
Strawberry follows the latest specification outlined in the graypaper which itself is still maturing. 

## Features

- Written in Go for performance and reliability
- Milestones one "IMPORTER: State-transitioning conformance tests pass and can import blocks." has been implemented and [sent for review on Nov 20th 2024](https://github.com/w3f/jam-milestone-delivery/pull/6)
- Working on Milestone 2 and beyond.
- Easy to configure and extend.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- Make
- Go 1.25.5 or higher
- Rust 1.81.1 or higher

### Installation
Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eigerco/strawberry.git
    cd strawberry
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
   make build 
    ```

3. Run the demo executable:
    ```bash
    ./strawberry
    ```
## Usage
This demo app starts up a simple http server with one endpoint.
The import block endpoint can be accessed at `POST /block/import`

Usage example:
```bash
curl -i -X POST localhost:8080/block/import -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary "@demo-block-sample.json"
```

This returns:
```
{"message":"extrinsic guarantees validation failed, err: anchor block not present within recent blocks","status":"error"}
```
Meaning that the block is being validated.

## Docker

A single `linux/amd64` image runs in two modes, selected by the `JAM_FUZZ`
environment variable. The image follows the [JAM standard target packaging
spec](https://github.com/davxy/jam-conformance/tree/main/fuzz-proto#standard-target-packaging).

Build:

```bash
docker build -t strawberry .
```

**Normal mode** — validator node listening on UDP 30000 with baked-in dev configs:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 30000:30000/udp strawberry
```

To use your own keys/config, mount over the baked-in files:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 30000:30000/udp \
    -v "$PWD/appconfig.json:/app/appconfig.json:ro" \
    -v "$PWD/test_validators.json:/app/test_validators.json:ro" \
    strawberry
```

**Fuzz mode** — JAM conformance target speaking the fuzz protocol over a Unix socket:

```bash
docker run --rm \
    -e JAM_FUZZ=1 \
    -e JAM_FUZZ_SPEC=tiny \
    -e JAM_FUZZ_DATA_PATH=/tmp/jam/data \
    -e JAM_FUZZ_SOCK_PATH=/tmp/jam/fuzz.sock \
    -e JAM_FUZZ_LOG_LEVEL=info \
    -v /tmp/jam:/tmp/jam \
    strawberry
```

`JAM_FUZZ_SPEC` accepts `tiny` or `full`.

> The image bakes a freshly-generated ed25519 keypair for local dev. **Do not use it in production** — generate your own `test_validators.json`.

## Run tests

### Unit tests

```shell
make test
```

### Integration tests
Integration tests validate our code using the test vectors provided by [this](https://github.com/w3f/jamtestvectors) repository.
All integration tests are grouped within the `tests/integrations` folder, and the test cases/vectors (JSON and BIN files) are located in the `tests/integration/vectors` directory.
To execute these tests, use the following command:
```shell
make integration
```
